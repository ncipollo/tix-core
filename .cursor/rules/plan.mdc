# Plan

You may be asked to create a plan and then execute tasks. The following is guidance for that plan:
- When asked to "create a plan", always create the plan file.
- Always use markdown as a format.
- You should create the plan within the root of the project.
- A plan should have multiple markdown sectios.
- The first section should be overview of the plan.
- Next section should be assumptions.
- Last section should be the task list.
- The user may request additional sections.

# Tasks Lists

You may be asked to create a task list and then execute tasks. The following is guidance for this task list:
- You should create the task list within the root of the project.
- The last task should always be "Delete this task list".
- Always check off the task when you are done.
- We should add a section to the task list which outlines assumptions we are making about our tasks.
- We should also add a section which provides file structure information for the package we are working within.
